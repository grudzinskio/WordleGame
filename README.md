## Wordle Implementation

## Description
This project is a custom implementation of the popular word-guessing game Wordle, developed by a team of five developers. Our goal is to deliver a fully functional application that caters to a diverse range of users—including players, administrators, and testers—by addressing 15 predetermined user stories.

Players can enjoy guessing 5-letter words with real-time feedback, while administrators gain tools for analyzing user guesses and managing word sets. Testers are equipped with features to validate the application's functionality through automated input and output processing.
